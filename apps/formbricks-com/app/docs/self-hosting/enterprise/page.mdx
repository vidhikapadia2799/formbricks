# Enterprise License Request (Beta)

We're handing out free enterprise license keys during our beta.

Additional to the AGPL licensed Formbricks core, the Formbricks repository contains code licensed under an [Enterprise license](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/packages/ee/LICENSE). This additional functionality is not part of the AGPLv3 licensed Formbricks core and is designed to meet the needs of larger teams and enterprises. This advanced functionality is already included in the Docker images, but you need an [Enterprise License Key](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/license) to unlock it.
