#### Link Surveys

# Data Prefilling in Link Surveys

Data prefilling via the URL allows you to increase conversion rate by prefilling data you already have in a different system.

## Purpose

URL prefilling of data comes in handy when you:

- Have data for some of the respondents, but not all
- Have data in a different system (e.g. your database) and want to add it to the user profile in Formbricks
- Want to embed the first question in an email and increase conversion by prefilling the choice

## Quick Example

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Example URL">

```sh
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?question_id=5
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
## How it works

To prefill the first question of a survey, append `?question_id=answer` at the end of the survey URL. The answer has to match the expected type of the question. For example, if the first question is a rating question, the answer has to be a number. If the first question is a single select question, the answer has to be a string.

Please make sure the answer is [URL encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/).

<Note>
  ## Prefill only the first question Currently, you can only prefill the first question of a link survey.
</Note>

## Where do I find my question Id?

You find the `questionId` in the Advanced Settings at the bottom of each question card in the Survey Editor. As you see, you can update the `questionId` to any string you like. However, once you published your survey, this `questionId` cannot be updated anymore:

<MdxImage
  src={QuestionId}
  alt="The question Id is located at the bottom of each question card in the survey editor."

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"

## Examples

Here are a few examples to get you started:

### Rating Question

<CodeGroup title="Translates to 5 stars / points / emojis">

```sh
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?nps_question_id=10
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
### Single Select Question (Radio)
<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Chooses the option 'Very disappointed' in the single select question. The string has to be identical to the option in your question">

```sh
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?single_select_question_id=Very%20disappointed
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
### Multi Select Question (Checkbox)
<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Selects three options 'Sun, Palms and Beach' in the multi select question. The strings have to be identical to the options in your question">

```sh
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?multi_select_question_id=Sun%2CPalms%2CBeach
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
### Open Text Question
<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Adds 'I love Formbricks' as the answer to the open text question">

```sh
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?openText_question_id=I%20love%20Formbricks
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
### CTA Question
<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Adds 'clicked' as the answer to the CTA question. Alternatively, you can set it to 'dismissed' to skip the question.">

```txt
https://app.formbricks.com/s/clin3yxja52k8l80hpwmx4bjy?cta_question_id=clicked
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
## Validation

Make sure that the answer in the URL matches the expected type for the first question.

The URL validation works as follows:

- For Rating or NPS questions, the response is parsed as a number and verified if it's accepted by the schema.
- For CTA type questions, the valid values are "clicked" (main CTA) and "dismissed" (skip CTA).
- For Consent type questions, the valid values are "accepted" (consent given) and "dismissed" (consent not given).
- All other question types are strings.
