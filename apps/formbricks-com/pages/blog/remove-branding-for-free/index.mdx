_While it was always possible to remove the Formbricks branding from link surveys, you can now remove it from all survey types incl. in-app and website surveys for free._

## Why are we doing this?

To be fair, the branding removal was always possible and legal under the AGPLv3 license. 

BUT it was cumbersome, unnecessarily cumbersome: You needed to take it out of the codez, build a new image and host it. And every time we released a new version, you had to do the same üòÆ‚Äçüí®

**We didn't like that. It's an arbitrary limitation** which only adds work to your already busy day.  If it is really important for you to remove the branding and self-host, this was your only option. Until now.

### Remove all branding on self-hosted ‚úÖ

This is why you can now just toggle the branding off, if you like - for free.

If you want to support our project, you're obviously more than welcome to keep the beautiful branding on (and enjoy your life filled with good karma üòõ).

### What about Formbricks Cloud?
On the cloud, branding removal is handled differently. Here is an overview:

| **Branding Removal** | Link surveys | Website surveys | In-app surveys |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Self-hosted | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Formbricks Cloud | Part of Pro plan ($30) | Add credit card (free) | Add credit card (free) |

## So how does Formbricks make money than?

With our Enterprise Edition. If you use our Cloud, you get to use the Formbricks Enterprise Edition for free once you added a credit card. After the free monthly responses are used up, you pay a fee per submission and identified user. For a more detailed overview, please [have a look at our pricing page.](/pricing) 

If you want to self-host the Formbricks Enterprise Edition, you need to [buy an Enterprise license from us](/docs/self-hosting/enterprise). These licenses are designed for larger companies who have complex data privacy and security requirements. Self-hosting Formbricks makes the compliance process a loooot easier. These licenses come on a yearly basis. If you're interested, [let's just have a chat.](https://cal.com/johannes/30)
